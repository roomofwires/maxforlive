# Max for Live Devices by [Room of Wires](https://roomofwires.com)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roomofwires/maxforlive/master/images/brokenwires.jpg)

The custom built devices in this repository were created specifically for the making of new tracks by Room of Wires, and are made available here for free and without warranty.

There is no documentation - just add them into your Live set, have a play and see what happens.

Requires Ableton Live 10 Suite, or Standard with Max for Live, available [here](https://www.ableton.com/en/shop/live/). They may work with earlier versions, I've no idea.
